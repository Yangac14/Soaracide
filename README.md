This is a game that involves the player in the form of a ball avoiding random objects that generate at random.  By pressing and holding spacebar, the player is able to go upwards while pressing nothing pushes the player downward.  Touching the top or bottom of the screen will result in losing.

!!!IMPORTANT!!!
In order to play and test the game, you will need to download Processing I3 (the most up to date version).  When you download the program, you will need to go under "sketch" and import the libraries called: processing.sound, processing.video.
